        <h4 class="text-center">Privacy Policy</h4>

        <p>2456307 Ontario Inc. d/b/a MyBTC.ca ( "MyBTC.ca" "we"/"us") is committed to protecting your privacy. We make the website MyBTC.ca (the "Website") available together with our services as further described in our Terms of Use (the "Services"). This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, store, use and distribute information about our users through the Website and Services.
        </p>
        <p>Consent: By using the Website or our Services you consent to the use of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy. Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, your Personal Information will not be used for any other purpose without your consent. We will not actively collect Personal Information for the purpose of sale or marketing in a way that specifically identifies the individual. In other words, we don't sell customer lists. You may withdraw your consent to our processing of your Personal Information at any time. However, withdrawing consent may result in your inability to continue using the Website and/or the Services.
        </p>
        <p>Collection of Information: We aim to collect, use and disclose only such information as is required to enable us to provide the Services, including verifying identification and authenticating transactions, to maintain transaction histories and customer lists, to respond to your inquiries or provide feedback, for identification and authentication purposes, and for service improvement. We will maintain the confidentiality of any Personal Information you provide to us on signing up for our Services or contacting us with questions or for further information and we will use it only for the purposes for which we have collected it (subject to the exclusions and disclosures we have listed below), unless you agree that we may disclose it to other third parties.
        </p>
        <p>Two types of information may be collected through the Website and our Services: Personal Information and Non-Personal Information. This Privacy Policy does not extend to the collection, use or disclosure of the Non-Personal Information (as defined further below).
        </p>
        <p>"Personal Information" is personally identifiable information, such as your name, e-mail address, phone number, home address, date of birth, occupation and bank name. At the time of collection, we will clearly identify the information being collected and the purposes for which it will be used. It is always your choice whether or not to provide Personal Information but if you choose not to provide certain requested Personal Information, in some instances you may not be able to register to use the Website or be able to access and use the Website at all. In other instances, your choice not to provide certain other Personal Information may mean that you will not be able to use certain features of the Website. We may collect Personal Information in respect of the Website through service purchases; communications with you, transaction and user authentication procedures, user support; and surveys.
        </p>
        <p>"Non-Personal Information" is information of an anonymous nature, such as an Internet Protocol Address (IP Address) provided it has been stripped of personal information, the domain used to access the Website, and the type and version of browser or operating system being used by visitors to the website. Aggregate information, such as demographic statistics of our users (e.g. average age or geographical allocation of our users), number of visitors, what pages users access or visit, and average time spent on the Website is not considered Personal Information unless it is specifically linked to an identifiable individual.
        </p>
        <p>Although the use of certain Non-Personal Information collected, used or disclosed through the Internet as described herein is not restricted (and to the extent that such is the case, the obligations under this Privacy Policy do not apply to such information), we provide information in this Privacy Policy about the collection of such information for the sake of transparency with respect to the operation of the Website. Use of Information: We collect Personal Information for the following purposes:
          <ul>
            <li>    Services: In order to use our Services you must provide certain Personal Information to us such as your mobile phone number, Bitcoin wallet address, payment information, home address, occupation bank name and email address. In general, none of your account registration information will be shared with any other users of the Website or our Services.
            </li>
            <li>    ID Verification: Users may have their identity verified through SecureFact which utilizes multiple sources including Equifax, TransUnion and telecom companies. Users may also have MyBTC.ca verify identification by uploading copies of their ID, connecting to their financial service provider via Flinks or at Canada Post through their Digital Proof of Identity Service. In order to verify your identity, at the very least, you must provide us with your name, date of birth, address and city. This information is then provided to Equifax, TransUnion or Canada Post to verify your identify.

Alternatively, Users may choose to have their ID verified through MyBTC.ca's In-house Photo ID service, in which case you will be required to send us your name, date of birth, address and city, proof of address, as well as upload copies of your government issued photo IDs. ID verification is required to use the Services.
            </li>
            <li>    Note that if you choose to connect your account via Flinks you are consenting to pass us information that the respective financial institution has on record for you such as name(s) on the account(s), account number(s), currency type, balance, transaction history, mailing address, phone number and email address. Connecting your account via Flinks is completely optional and may be skipped or opted out of at any time. MyBTC.ca will store the Personal Information required for regulatory compliance.

            </li>
            <li>    Authentication: We may also request further proof of identification in order to verify access to your account, including when your initial credentials are rejected or when you change the phone number or email address associated with your account. Such evidence may include a copy of government photo ID, current photograph, proof of mailing address, proof of cell phone number or email address ownership, as determined by us in the circumstances.
            </li>
            <li>    Transactional Notifications: Despite your indicated preferences, we provide notifications for certain activities relating to your use of our Services such as sending personal identification numbers to your mobile phone in order to verify purchases and confirmations to your email address when a transaction has been completed.
