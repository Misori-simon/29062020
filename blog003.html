<h4>          Why Do Coinbase US Clients Buy Bitcoin From Fastcoins.us?
</h4>
<p>  Since Coinbase's graduated limit increase model leaves most new Canadian Coinbase users with very low limits, clients are shifting to Fastcoins.us as US's fastest fiat on-ramp. Once Bitcoin is purchased, they then tend to trade for altcoins on Coinbase in US. Generally, Coinbase's weekly limit is only $300.00 CAD where you start by linking and storing your Visa and Mastercard debit card within your Coinbase account profile.
</p>
<p>  Since some of US’s biggest banks that issue compatible debit cards for online transactions prohibit cryptocurrency purchases via Visa and Mastercard, it’s common to hear of Canadian Coinbase clients who’ve experienced an error or incompatibility message when attempting to link their card on Coinbase.
</p>
<p>  In short, it’s much quicker, easier and reliable for Canadians to buy Bitcoins from Fastcoins.us using Interac e-Transfer and send those Bitcoin directly to their Coinbase account wallet. Working closely with existing Coinbase clients has given us insight into the needs of cryptocurrency traders and HODLers alike. Fastcoins.us is currently on standby to service Canadian Coinbase clients who are blocked by many of the fiat to digital asset purchase limitations.
</p>
<h4>Boost Bitcoin Buying Limits with Fastcoins.us
  </h4>
<p>  Once your Fastcoins.us account is created and verified, you’ll have access to a variety of payment options that include Interac e-Transfer, Flexepin vouchers, Cash or Debit at US Post and Bank Wire, among others.
</p>
<p>  When Canadians need to buy Bitcoins instantly, our Flexepin payment method allows every new or existing client 24/7/365 funding access with limits 800% greater than Coinbase. However, the Interac e-Transfer payment option is most popular and offers buying limits over 3000% higher than Coinbase in US; which is 100% compatible with all Canadian banks and Credit Unions. When you look at limits on a per week basis using Interac e-Transfer, you're gaining almost 250x more spending power to reach your Bitcoin buying goals.
</p>
<h4>Why Would I Use Both Coinbase and Fastcoins.us?</h4>

  <p>Most clients purchase Bitcoin fast from Fastcoins.us and send the BTC to their Coinbase account wallet for price speculation or trading immediately into other cryptocurrencies. Once the timing, market conditions, and price is right, you’ll probably want to trigger a sell order on Coinbase and easily withdraw your converted Bitcoin, or crypto, for Canadian dollars.

  Thanks to Coinbase’s unique partnership with PayPal, traders and sellers can lock-in and cash out their profits instantly. The PayPal option is also great if you need to sell your crypto to pay another merchant, friend or family member in Canadian dollars on a weekend or holiday; which are typical times where the banks don’t process or settle transactions over the bill payment, bank wire or electronic funds networks.
  Why Don’t I Wait for Coinbase to Raise My Limits?

  Canadians can hop in the driver’s seat by setting up their Fastcoins.us account and exchange CAD to BTC for faster trading, leveraging and buying opportunities. Fastcoins.us understands that speed is important for those buying BTC in US. The feedback we’ve received is that the execution of delivery from Fastcoins.us to Coinbase is far more important than fees or especially the ability to have higher limits. Most Fastcoins.us clients who trade on Coinbase have expressed their delight after experiencing fast delivery and higher available limits.

  In addition, we see many customers create an account and verify themselves with Fastcoins.us so they have back-pocket options for the next bull run. It’s always a good idea to be prepared so you’re all set up to pull the trigger when the market conditions best meet your buying needs.

  Lastly, Fastcoins.us continues to help enthused Coinbase clients procure their Bitcoins with ease as we boast industry leading client engagement. Our client care specialists will resolve your ticket and offer high touch, high value customer service including our same day reply promise. You will never speak to a robot or get stuck in an endless loop — something the big guys can’t seem to offer. Don’t be surprised if a member of our staff saves the arthritis and calls you on the phone to troubleshoot your scenario and offer helpful guidance for new clients.

  The best time to create your Fastcoins.us account and become verified is always today or where there’s sideway market movement without much up or down volatility. For instance, the 2017 bull run left many prospective buyers without the opportunity to buy Bitcoin when they wanted to because the demand was so overwhelming that all the Canadian Exchanges and Brokerage overloaded with ID verifications in the queue and handling on a first-come-first-served basis — causing many investors to missout on the explosive buying opportunities

  Fastcoins.us is pleased to onboard any existing Canadian Coinbase clients today so that you can utilize both platforms to meet your buying needs. Let’s get you started by navigating to the Fastcoins.us Login/Signup page to open and verify your account for the next big price increase.
